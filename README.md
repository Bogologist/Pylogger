Pylogger is a collection of Python scripts to process dipwell, piezometer and dipwell data from Odyssey water loggers - http://odysseydatarecording.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=59&product_id=50 They were written by Adekunle Ibiyemi and Gillian Donaldson-Selby, James Hutton Institute, Aberdeen, Scotland. Additional required data, such as measured datums, offsets, Elevation Head, Surface elevation are stored in the look-up .csv files. We have provided examples from our own projects. Internally the scripts are set up to use our own offsets and second order polynomials. This can easily be changed.

We make no guarantee regarding the efficacy or accuracy of these scripts. If you have question you can email gillian.donaldson-selby@hutton.ac.uk
